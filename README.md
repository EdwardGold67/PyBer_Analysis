## Overview of Pyber ride share project
The purpose of this project was to perfom an analysis on PyBer to determine rider-ship and fare costs from city to city. Using Pandas and Python I created a summary DataFrame that held the metrics needed to create tables and visualizations via matplotlib. The visualization, a multiple-line graph, showed the total weekely fares for each city type and allowed for a clearer understanding of the data. The multiple-line graph as seen below allows for an easy interpretation.  

## Results
Created a ride-sharing summary dataframe by city type by:
* getting the total rides for each city type
* Getting the total drivers foreach city type
* Retrieve thte total amount of fares for each city type
* Calculate the average fare per ride for each city type
* Calculate the average fare per driver for each city type
* Created the data frame and formated the columns

## Election Audit Results
### Election Outcomes 
The first step in my audit after importing the csv and os was to link the election results csv to python by assigning a variable to load a file from a path. Following that step I assigned a variable to save the file to a path. Reading and writing data, I performed calculations on the vote count and used conditional statements and loops to calculate the results. The following bullet points contain the election audit results:
